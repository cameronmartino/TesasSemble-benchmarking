Benchmarking for TesasSemble

# Toy

Simple low-depth but high coverage synthetically generated reads. Two samples for slightly altered genomes (i.e. phylogenetically simillar).

# Low-complexity

Three simillar taxa (different strains of E. Coli) generated reads over time using the [CAMISM](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/CAMISIM) generation tool. 

# High-complexity

TODO
